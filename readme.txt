* **Saved Searches** - Add products to your store in bulk by saving a search. No need to add products one by one, unless you want to.

* **Store-Specific Merchant Selection** - Select exactly which merchants to promote on a store-by-store basis. No need to search unrelated merchants when you’re creating a niche store. 

* **Automatically Update Products** - Updating doesn't require any action on your part. Product information updates automatically.

* **Automatically Add New Products** - When using "Saved Searches", any new products that match your search will automatically be added to your store during updates. There's no need to continually monitor merchant data feeds for new products.

* **Automatically Remove Old Products** - When a merchant removes a product from their inventory, it will automatically be removed from your store.

* **Updates Run in Background** - Most product importers require you to sit and watch the update until it finishes. Datafeedr performs product updates in the background whether you're watching or not. 

* **Character Encoding** - Properly handles special characters and accents when importing products.

* **Customizable Product Information** - Customize product name, description, and other details before or after loading products into WordPress.

* **Custom Products** - Add products from CSV importers or other sources to your store without conflicting with products imported by the Datafeedr WooCommerce Importer plugin.

The problem is, your store will be a duplicate of every other site using that merchant’s feed. Our plugin ensures your store will be unique by letting you create the categories you want and add unique groups of products to those categories.

* **SEO** - Works seamlessly with popular SEO plugins such as WordPress SEO, All In One SEO and WooCommerce SEO.

* **rel="nofollow"** - All affiliate links have the rel="nofollow" attribute added automatically.

* **Masked Affiliate Links** - Prevent leaking PageRank to advertisers by using our WooCommerce Cloak Affiliate Links plugin (free).
